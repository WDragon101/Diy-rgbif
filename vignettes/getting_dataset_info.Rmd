It can sometimes be useful to get information about datasets rather than the data which they contain. 

In this article, I will explain the various methods available to access dataset meta-data stored within the [GBIF registry](https://www.gbif.org/developer/registry).

## dataset_search() and dataset_export()

```R 

```

## datasets

Returns data not found in dataset search. Useful if you know the dataset key

```R 

```

## Other functions
